# Ray-Reflection
MATLAB script that emulates how rays bounce off of walls

This program emulates rays like light or sound and calculates how they would reflect off of walls.
This can be used to check out acoustics of a house or apartment. 

The start position can be declared or chosen with the cursor.
The range of angles checked can be set.
The number of rays checked can be set. 
A color system can be implemented based on intensity of the ray. 
This code can also take curved walls, depening on function used to describe the wall.
